# SunAndEarth

## Description

I explore 3.js trying to create sun, earth and moon and make them revolve around each other like they do in the solar system. 
Developed the animation in the image below. To keep the size of the gif small, the image was exported at a lower per second 
count and hence stutters in the image below are noticiable. It however runs at full 60fps in the browser.

## Libraries Used

1. 3.js
2. canvas-sketch-cli
3. Node.js

I am following the instructions from Advanced Creative Coding with WebGL & Shaders by Matt DesLauriers on Frontendmasters.com and 
have extended his animation by adding sun and making the earth revolve around the sun and the moon revolve around the earth.

## Instruction to Run the Project

1. Install Dependencies using npm install
2. Run canvas-sketch sketch.js command to start the development server and view the animation in browser
